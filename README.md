GestureMath
===========

##Gesture-based algebra for the iPad. 

####Interviews and observations indicate 2 main cognitive barriers that algebra learners face:  

* Uncertainty about which parts of an equation can be manipulated, and how. 
* Anxiety about making a mistake, and proceeding down a "wrong path" that won't lead to a solution. 

####GestureMath reduces these barrriers by providing an intuitive, touch-based interface for performing algebraic operations on equations. 

================================

* **First, select part of the equation to interact with.**
 * Dynamic targets will appear to indicate what operations you can perform with the selected term(s).

* **If you make a mistake, use the scrolling history window at the top of the screen to roll back to any previous step of the equation.**

* **Although GestureMath was designed with basic algebra learners in mind, it can also support more advanced equations.**
 * Mathematical constants
