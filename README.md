GestureMath
===========

##Gesture-based algebra for the iPad. 

####Interviews and observations indicate 2 main cognitive barriers that algebra learners face:  

* Uncertainty about which parts of an equation can be manipulated, and how. 
* Anxiety about making a mistake, and proceeding down a "wrong path" that won't lead to a solution. 

####GestureMath reduces these barrriers by providing an intuitive, gesture-based interface for performing algebraic operations on equations.
